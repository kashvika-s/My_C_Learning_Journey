# Hello Engineer - Day 1
This is my first C program.

---

## Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    printf("Hello Future Engineer, I will master machines!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## What I Learned Today:
1.What is programming and how it controls a machine
2.Structure of a C program (main, header files, return)
3.Use of printf() to display output
4.How code is compiled and executed -> RAM -> CPU
5.How to push code to GitHub

## How This Program Works
 (Step-by-Step):
1.Code is written in C using printf() function.
2.Compiler converts C code to machine code.
3.CPU reads instructions and executes them.
4.RAM temporarily stores program and variables.
5.Screen displays the output.

## Output:

Hello Future Engineer, I will master machines!
